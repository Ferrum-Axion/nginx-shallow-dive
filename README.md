# Nginx Shallow Dive

Liad: This configuration sets up a basic Nginx HTTP server listening on port 80 and serving files from the /srv directory. 
It uses index.html as the default page and enables directory listing with autoindex on. The server is configured for local access using localhost and supports standard MIME types.
